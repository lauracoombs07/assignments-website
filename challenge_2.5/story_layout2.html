                    The extinct giant ground sloths were some of the only mammals that had digestive systems large enough
                    to process the huge avocado seeds whole. They feasted on the fruit and then dispersed the seeds far and
                    wide. All tree sloths that we see today evolved from giant ground sloths. There were thought to be over
                    80 different types with the largest (Megatherium) reaching over six meters in height. There is even
                    evidence to suggest that several different species of marine sloth existed, feeding from sea grass and
                    seaweed in shallow water.

                    Sloths are the undisputed pull-up world champions. From the moment they are born sloths are able to lift
                    their entire body weight upwards with just one arm. Not only that, but sloths have 30% less muscle mass
                    than similar sized mammals and are over three times stronger than the average human. They have a highly
                    specialised muscle arrangement that can produce enough strength to withstand the force of a jaguar trying
                    to rip them from the tree. Specialised tendons in the sloth’s hands and feet lock into place, allowing
                    them to hang upside down for long periods of time without wasting any energy. This unique locking
                    mechanism is also how sloths are able to sleep while hanging from a tree branch. They have even been
                    known to remain suspended upside down after death!

                    Although they spend most of their time in the trees, sloths are surprisingly good swimmers. They can
                    swim through water three times faster than they can move on the ground! Three-fingered sloths have two
                    more neck vertebrae than any other mammal. This allows them to turn their heads through 270° and
                    effortlessly keep their nose above water when swimming.

                    Sloths have an unusual method of camouflage. Cracks in their hair allow many different species of algae
                    and fungi to grow which makes them appear green. Some species of fungi living in sloth fur have been
                    found to be active against certain strains of bacteria, cancer and parasites! Sloth hair also provides
                    home to an entire ecosystem of invertebrates — some species of which are found nowhere else on earth
                    (like the ‘sloth moth’). A single sloth can host up to 950 moths and beetles within its fur at once.

                    Sloths have the lowest metabolic rate of any mammal, which means that it takes them a long time to
                    digest anything. They have an incredibly large and permanently full four-chambered stomach, which can
                    account for up to 30% of their body mass. In two-fingered sloths, this over-sized stomach is supported
                    by 46 ribs (23 pairs) which is more than any other mammal!
